Requirements
============
This theme makes use of a font called 'gelly' out of the Artwiz fonts
package.
It also requires PekWM in version 0.1.11, maybe it runs fine with other
versions but it's currently only tested with this version.

Install
=======
Extract the archive and copy the folder 'gorgeous' to your PekWM
themes folder, e.g. ~/.pekwm/themes/ or /usr/share/pekwm/themes/
That might differ from system to system.
